# Quant Puzzle Editorials

A curated collection of worked solutions to advanced quant puzzles, each one written as a standalone, well-structured PDF.  
These editorials focus on the kinds of problems youâ€™ll encounter in quantitative finance interviews and research:  
**stochastic calculus, probability, dynamic programming, and mathematical modelling.**
Some are classics. Others may have been field-tested under real pressure.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Sharpen understanding of core quantitative methods
- Show clean, rigorous problem solving under realistic constraints
- Serve as a high-quality teaching resource for others in the field
- Demonstrate technical depth beyond just theory

Only puzzles that meet at least one of the following criteria are included:
- **Challenging** - requires real insight to solve
- **Interesting** - elegant, surprising, or clever in structure
- **Important** - frequently asked in quant interviews or foundational to quant finance

## Structure

Each editorial is written in LaTeX and compiled as a standalone PDF with the following layout:
- Problem Statement
- Core Ideas
- Solution
- Takeaways (why it matters, where it's useful)

Puzzles are numbered and titled for easy reference.

## Difficulty Ratings

The scale is calibrated to reflect difficulty for someone with a solid postgraduate-level background in financial maths:
- Easy; A sharp postgrad should solve this unaided.
- Standard; Bread and butter for a working Quant. If you can't solve it, you should fix that.
- Interview-Level; The kinds of questions that show up in interviews to separate the strong from the merely competent.
- Insanity; Rare, terrifying or deeply subtle. You won't see many of these, and that's a mercy.
