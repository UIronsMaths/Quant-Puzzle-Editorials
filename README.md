# Quant Puzzle Editorials

A curated collection of worked solutions to advanced quant puzzles, each one written as a standalone, well-structured PDF.  
These editorials focus on the kinds of problems youâ€™ll encounter in quantitative finance interviews and research:  
**stochastic calculus, probability, dynamic programming, and mathematical modelling.**
